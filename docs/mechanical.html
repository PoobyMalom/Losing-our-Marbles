                        The mechanical system of the marble art machine has five main sections: the bin, the lift, the pathway, the sorters, and the frame. The marble starts in the bin where it rolls down an angle and is then pushed into a screw. This screw, powered by a motor, drives the marbles out of the bin and up a tube. After being pushed through the tube, the marble reaches the pathway. In the pathway, the marble undergoes color sensing and is pushed over a ledge by the solenoid and into the sorters. The sorters direct the marble either into the marble frame where the image is created, or into the trash chute to go back into the bin. Once an image is complete, a slide will be pulled from underneath the marble frame and will drop all marbles back into the bin.

                        For the mechanical design, two main considerations were kept in mind: designing for variability and designing for the user/a polished product. As learned early on, all of the marbles were slightly different sizes, so we kept that in mind when choosing, designing, and fabricating parts.  More importantly, however, we designed for an aesthetic appeal to the user. A large amount of material selection was based on user choice and viewing in mind.

                        The bin contains all of the marbles that will eventually be transported up into the lift. The bin consists of three acrylic walls, one MDF wall, and one MDF bottom. The bin features a gently sloped surface that rolls marbles towards the lift while not allowing them to bounce to far forward when falling out of the chutes

                        The lift is driven by the screw and was designed with simplicity and aesthetics in mind. To limit marble jamming, the tube was designed with as few curves as possible and wide curve angles (no less than ninety degrees). Due to the unique angles and shapes required for the bottom tube attached to the bin and the top tube interfacing with the solenoid, the two tubes were printed. The middle tube was selected as a clear plastic tube to allow the viewer/user to see the “behind-the-scenes” aspect of our art maker and enhance its color and creativity. To affix the clear tube to the other printed tubes semicircle clamps were designed with adjustable tightness.

                        The pathway was designed with color sensor optimization in mind. The entire chamber is black and features a front plate that extends down into the sorting mechanism and up to the tube. The plate and marble chamber color increase the darkness and allows for better color sensing. The plate was attached to the chamber by threading 4/40 bolts into holes that were printed slightly smaller than 4/40 size to allow for ease of tolerance. Further, better color sensing was achieved through an inlay in the back that allows the sensor to be screwed down closer to the marble. Pathway length ensures that the solenoid does not need high power to push the marble over as the distance the marble needs to travel is less than one marble length past where it sits when color is sensed.                    </p>
