                            In sprint one, we wanted to see if we could sense and sort the marble into two columns in an unintegrated system.

                        In this sprint we wanted to see if we could model and protoype most parts of our system in an isolated way to see if they could work on their own. We also wanted to try some simple integration into a very rudimentary version of our system with only one sorter and two paths

                        All mechanical goals were achieved during this sprint. 
                        The first marble pathway was prototyped to allow color sensing and solenoid testing. The pathway is a chamber that allows marbles to fall into a chamber where they are color sensed and bumped over a ledge with a solenoid into a sorting mechanism and eventually frame. This first pathway did not include any front plate but had basic attachments for the color sensor and solenoid so testing could be performed. The pathway mechanism was kept separate from the sorting mechanism and frame. 
                        A rudimentary sorting mechanism and frame were also prototyped. The sorting mechanism, operated by a rear-mounted servo, could sort two columns with accuracy and four after minor modification. This sorting mechanism was attached to a frame with two columns and allowed us to test marble sorting. Together, the sorting mechanism and frame were attached to a basic container that could hold the marbles once dropped, and the frame upright.
